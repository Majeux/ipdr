NOW
	- ham7tc: 10 basic is 6 seconds faster than 7->8->9->10
	- check difference inc 1 and inc more
	- check difference small inc step at high level
	- fixing "finding x strategy" message
	- duplicate cubes in solver (including activation). maybe search goes wrong with act literal
  - only 1st frame needed? propagation fixes everything
		- continuing from last k (dec) maybe increases strategy length 
	- track initial cti and regeneralize
	- actually useful progress file (skip verbose obligation timing output)
	- profiling
	- random seed experiments
	- replicate pebbling paper

TODO
	- decrement: continue from last k or copy only first
	- sat.core.minimize setting
	- generalization statistic
	- some indexing/caching optimization from IC3 git
	- proof/disprove minimal traces (heuristic?)
	- get HIF from act variable
	- doubles and not deleted clauses in final solver output
	- remember queue between iterations??
	- tseitin transition
	- pebbling paper maybe used older mockturtle
	- format pebbling strategy
	- alternative block
	- pushing subsumed clauses
	
	DELTA
		- terminates later than original (maybe ok)
		- slower in some cases (factor 2), see g^xxxxx
			- Maybe because of extra logging overhead?

	EXPERIMENTS
		- Determine comparisons to pebbling paper
		- Compare speed of iterations between --optimize and not
		- Determine speedup for reusing
		- cleaner format for strategy (on/off)
