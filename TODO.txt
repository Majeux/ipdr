TODO
	- generalization statistic
	- some indexing/caching optimization from IC3 git
	- proof/disprove minimal traces (heuristic?)
	- continue from last known cardinality
	- get HIF from act variable
	- doubles and not deleted clauses in final solver output
	- remember queue between iterations??
	- tseitin transition
	
	DELTA
		- terminates later than original (maybe ok)
		- slower in some cases (factor 2), see g^xxxxx
			- Maybe because of extra logging overhead?

	EXPERIMENTS
		- Determine comparisons to pebbling paper
		- Compare speed of iterations between --optimize and not
		- Determine speedup for reusing
