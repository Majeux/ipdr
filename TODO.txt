NOW
	- check difference inc 1 and inc more
	- check difference small inc step at high level
	- track initial cti and regeneralize
	- actually useful progress file (skip verbose obligation timing output)

TODO
	- sat.core.minimize setting
	- generalization statistic
	- some indexing/caching optimization from IC3 git
	- proof/disprove minimal traces (heuristic?)
	- get HIF from act variable
	- doubles and not deleted clauses in final solver output
	- remember queue between iterations??
	- tseitin transition
	- pebbling paper maybe used older mockturtle
	- format pebbling strategy
	- alternative block
	- pushing subsumed clauses
	- track lowest changed frame
	
	EXPERIMENTS
		- vary over mic_retries
