NOW
  - only 1st frame needed? propagation fizes everything
	- final solver dump is empty
  - pdr_context {ctx, model, delta, seed}
	- actually useful progress file (skip verbose obligation timing output)
	- profiling
	- random seed experiments
	- replicate pebbling paper

TODO
	- sat.core.minimize setting
	- generalization statistic
	- some indexing/caching optimization from IC3 git
	- proof/disprove minimal traces (heuristic?)
	- get HIF from act variable
	- doubles and not deleted clauses in final solver output
	- remember queue between iterations??
	- tseitin transition
	- pebbling paper maybe used older mockturtle
	
	DELTA
		- terminates later than original (maybe ok)
		- slower in some cases (factor 2), see g^xxxxx
			- Maybe because of extra logging overhead?

	EXPERIMENTS
		- Determine comparisons to pebbling paper
		- Compare speed of iterations between --optimize and not
		- Determine speedup for reusing
